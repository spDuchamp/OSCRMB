This project contains ESP8266 Arduino code for the OSC controlled Rotary Magnetic Bow and control systems used in the making of the albums "[Electroduochord](https://stefanpowell.bandcamp.com/album/electroduochord)" and "[Autonomous Drone Lullabies](https://stefanpowell.bandcamp.com/album/autonomous-drone-lullabies)".

The project also includes the STL file of the 3D printed wheel (3D model by [JP Timmerman](https://www.thingiverse.com/rodmod/designs)) to attach to the IQ Vertiq 2306 2200KV motor. The wheel has slots for 8mmx3mm cylindrical neodymium iron boron magnets.  All the album recordings were done using a 6 magnet configuration in positions 1,4,6,9,12,14 of the 16 slot wheel.

***Warning: Keep kSpeed (motor redline value) within safe operating velocity.***
